# LCBO Search
A sample of how one could use web components to create some widgets. This uses the LCBO open api to generate an autocomplte
list of products. you may then select a product to get more details.

## Improvements
* currently you must select a product to collapse the autocomplte results. This could be removed so that `ESC` or clicking
on the DOM would collapse it.
